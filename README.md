# Implementing Static File Serving in Express

This exercise involved the development of a complete full-stack note-taking application, integrating a Node.js and Express backend with an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend.

The development process began with setting up the foundational backend logic in server.js and the interactive elements in script.js. A key aspect was establishing the RESTful API endpoints to support Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for notes, alongside configuring Express to serve static frontend files.

A significant challenge encountered during development was debugging the PUT endpoint using Postman. Initially, requests were not being processed as expected, leading to validation errors. Through systematic debugging, including meticulous checks for typos in the endpoint URL, header configuration (Content-Type: application/json), and the structure of the JSON request body, the issue was successfully identified and resolved. This debugging process reinforced the importance of precise API request formatting and thorough testing.

The culmination of this exercise is a user-friendly note-taking application with robust multi-functional capabilities, allowing users to efficiently manage their thoughts and tasks.
